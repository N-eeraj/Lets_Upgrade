                    Iron Man not only has super strength, flight, durability, and armor plating, but also has another wide range of 
                    powers and abilities. Iron Man can create magnetic fields and manipulate them to create magnetic waves/magnetic pulses 
                    and make him magnetic proof. He can also make 3D holograms, which he uses as decoys or generates them on the different 
                    armors.
